                <p>A smart city is compused of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), to develop, deploy and promote sustainable development practices to address growing urbanization challenges. A big part of this ICT is essentially an intelligent network of connected objects and machjines that transmit data using wireless technology and the cloud   </p>
				<p>Citizens engage with smart city ecosystems in a variety of ways using smartphones and mobile devices, as well as connected cars and homes. Pairing devices and data with a city’s physical infrastructure and services can cut costs and improve sustainability. Communities can improve energy distribution, streamline trash collection, decrease traffic congestion and even improve air quality with help from the IoT. </p>
			<B><I><FONT SIZE="4"> Why do we need smart cities?</FONT> </I> </B>
			<p>Urbanization is non-ending phenomenon. Today, 54% of people worldwide live in cities, a proportion that’s expected to reach 66% by 20501. Combined with the overall population growth, urbanization will add another 2.5 billion people to cities over the next three decades2. Environmental, social and economic sustainability is a must to keep pace with this rapid expansion that is taxing our cities’ resources. 

Thankfully, more than 190 countries have agreed upon goals for sustainable growth - smart city technology is paramount to success and meeting these goals. </p>
